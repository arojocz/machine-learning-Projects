### 01 K-Nearest Neighbors
**Problem:** Multiclass and binary pattern classification across three benchmark datasets (Iris, LED7Digit, Heart Disease).  
**Approach:** KNN implemented from scratch using Euclidean distance with custom class-weighted confusion matrix aggregation. Evaluated with 5-Fold Cross-Validation and Leave-One-Out, fixed k=5.  
**Key finding:** Strong on separable data (Iris 97.5% balanced accuracy) but drops to 62.8% on Heart Disease — performance is dictated entirely by feature space geometry, not model complexity.

---

### 02 Multiclass Evaluation — KNN vs Gaussian Naive Bayes
**Problem:** Wine cultivar classification (3 classes) with full per-class metric reporting.  
**Approach:** Head-to-head benchmark of KNN (k=3) vs GaussianNB using Leave-One-Out, with per-class confusion matrices and Macro, Weighted, and Micro averaging.  
**Key finding:** GaussianNB achieves 97.8% macro F1 vs 71.5% for KNN — the gap is almost entirely explained by the absence of feature normalization, which distorts Euclidean distance on Wine's mixed-scale features.

---

### 03 Gaussian Naïve Bayes
**Problem:** Multiclass and binary classification across Iris, Heart Disease, and LED7Digit.  
**Approach:** GNB implemented from scratch using log-likelihood with Gaussian PDF. Evaluated with LOO and 10-Fold CV, reporting per-class Sensitivity, Specificity, and Balanced Accuracy.  
**Key finding:** Strong on simple distributions (Iris 96.5%) but sensitivity drops to 69% on LED7Digit's 10-class problem — the conditional independence assumption weakens as class overlap increases.

---

### 04 Decision Tree — Gini Impurity
**Problem:** Binary classification on three datasets (Iris versicolor vs virginica, Heart Disease, LED7Digit).  
**Approach:** Decision tree implemented from scratch using Gini impurity with exhaustive threshold search, depth-limited to 6. Evaluated with stratified Hold-Out 70/30 and compared against full-dataset results.  
**Key finding:** Heart Disease drops 18 points between full-dataset (91.7%) and hold-out (73.6%) evaluation — a textbook overfitting case showing the tree memorizes training patterns. Depth limiting alone is insufficient; pruning strategies would help.

---

### 05 PCA + Multi-Classifier Benchmark
**Problem:** Evaluate whether PCA-based dimensionality reduction improves classification across three datasets and five algorithms.  
**Approach:** Features standardized, reduced to minimum components explaining ≥90% variance (2–10 components), then benchmarked with KNN, GaussianNB, DecisionTree, RandomForest, and AdaBoost using stratified Hold-Out 70/30.  
**Key finding:** PCA helps when features are correlated — GaussianNB on LED7Digit jumps from 65.5% to 74.2% — but consistently hurts when the original feature space already provides clean class separation, as with GaussianNB on Iris (97.8% → 82.2%).

---

### 06 Gradient Descent & Linear Regression
**Problem:** Predict continuous values (disease progression and fuel efficiency) using linear regression trained via batch gradient descent.  
**Approach:** Gradient descent implemented from scratch with symbolic differentiation (SymPy). Applied to two datasets with 30,000 epochs, learning rate tuning, and cost curve tracking.  
**Key finding:** Auto MPG requires a learning rate 10x smaller than Diabetes — even after standardization, its feature gradients diverge at α=0.005. This highlights that learning rate is a dataset property, not just a hyperparameter to tune once.

---

### 07 Logistic Regression Classifier
**Problem:** Classify binary labels by approximating conditional probabilities while managing risks like infinite weight growth and feature scale disparities.  
**Approach:** Implementation from scratch using a computational graph to perform backpropagation via the chain rule. Optimized via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Gradient Descent, optional: incorporating $L_2$ regularization (Ridge) and Z-score standardization to ensure numerical stability and efficient convergence.
